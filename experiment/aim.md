### Learning Objectives

1. To understand the basic principles of Microfluidic microbial fuel cells (MMFCs) and their significance in sustainable energy production.

2. To learn the design and configuration of a microfluidic MFC simulator and understand different parameters such as fluid flow rates, electrode dimensions, and microbial species.

3. To learn about the optimization of MMFC performance under different conditions, such as varying substrate concentrations or electrode materials by adjusting the simulation parameters.
